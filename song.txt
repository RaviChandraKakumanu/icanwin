These days are getting real heavy
I'd break down if you let me go, oh-oh-oh
It could all go in an instant
Why wait when we could be living? Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
I got no direction, that's alright
Forget it all for just the night, mm-mmm-mmm
Singing under string lights
Sipping till the sunrise
Living like we only got today
Swearing off the dark times
Cursing at the moonlight
Yeah, we might be lost
But we'll find our way
Oh, we'll find our way (whoa)

Hold tight to all of your reasons
Fall in love with all of your seasons, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Sun kissed, oh, I miss the summer
Where I didn't fear all the thunder, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Got no direction, that's alright
Forget it all for just the night, mm-mmm-mmm
Singing under string lights
Sipping till the sunrise
Living like we only got today
Swearing off the dark times
Cursing at the moonlight
Yeah, we might be lost
But we'll find our way
Oh, we'll find our way
Oh-oh-oh (oh)
Oh-oh-oh (ooh)


apt apt apt apt!!!!!
Oh-oh-oh (one, two)
(One, two, three)
Singing under string lights
Sipping till the sunrise
Living like we only got today
Swearing off the dark times
Cursing at the moonlight (I'm cursing at the moonlight)
Yeah, we might be lost
But we'll find our way
Oh, we'll find our way
Oh-oh-oh (hey)
Oh-oh-oh (oh, oh)
Oh-oh-oh, oh (oh)
